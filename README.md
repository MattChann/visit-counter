# visit counter

Counts the number of visits a page receives using a hidden image.

Used for counting github profile visits ([as seen here](https://github.com/MattChann)).


_Inspired by [Flavio Copes' Article](https://flaviocopes.com/count-visits-static-site/) and [Ido Green's Implementation](https://glitch.com/~github-profile-counter-1)._
